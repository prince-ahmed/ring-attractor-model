# ring-attractor-model
Engineered ring attractor models and demonstrated that a locally connected network of neurons is used in Drosophila melanogasterâ€™s Ellipsoid Body to represent flying direction.




Started project by modelling single neurons through the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical description. Used information theory concepts to evaluate different abstractions and approximations to enable computation of more complex process such as stochastic inputs, dynamics of neural networks with excitatory \& inhibitory neurons, synapse plasticity, and learning.
