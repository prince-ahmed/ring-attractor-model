Started project by modelling single neurons through the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical description. Used information theory concepts to evaluate different abstractions and approximations to enable computation of more complex process such as stochastic inputs, dynamics of neural networks with excitatory \& inhibitory neurons, synapse plasticity, and learning.
