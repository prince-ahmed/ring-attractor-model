### Meeting 1

- [x] von mises fit on first x seconds and last x seconds
- [x] take the k-l divergence (super careful) between the 2 and this will be new error metric
- [x] for every fp-N plot error x noise with mean plotted enveloped in std


### Meeting 2

- [x] double check if von mises is equal if i compress the first and last third with firing rates
- [x] next simulation, get also kl between unprocessed first and last bit
- [x] plot errors with interval confidence
- [x] make gif of the bump
- [x] analyze the bump with other methods (pca? smt on MNE?)
- [x] can you check the firing pattern of neurons in a fixed point between when they first enter the fixed point, and then after a while


### Meeting 3

- [ ] Try to understand if being in a fixed point reduces the energy level of the network
- [x] Write a summary of what you did to calculate the noise where every fp_n situation is stable


### Meeting 4 

- [x] Analytic kl 
- [x] Compute divergence in sliding window 
- [x] We can compute length of vector of different in std, difference in mean, error between the two time points (not gaussian)
- [ ] If bump drift too much terminate

### Meeting 5

- [x] Presentation and plots
- [x] characterize noise
- [x] the stability parameters, with surface plot

### Meeting 6


- [ ] summarized mehrdad meeting
- [ ] redo fp weight stability plot counting spikes only in the surrounding of the fixed point

**wed after 3pm (meeting at 6.30)**
